; Glossary {{{

; Instant-repeat (1-char search)
; While Lightspeed is active, repeatedly pressing f/F/t/T goes to (or
; right before/after) the next/previous match (effectively repeats the
; last 1-character search with a count of 1). Pressing any other key
; exits from this "standby" mode; subsequent calls will behave as new
; invocations.

; Beacon (2-char search)
; An extmark positioned over an on-screen matching pair, giving
; information about how it can be reached. It can take on many forms; in
; the common case, the first field shows the 2nd character of the
; original pair, as a reminder (that is, it is shown on top of the
; _first_ character), while the second field shows a "target label"
; (that is possibly a "shortcut"). If there is only one match, the
; extmark shows the pair as it is, with a different highlighting (we
; will jump there automatically then).
; Beacons can also overlap each other - in that case, the invariant to
; be maintained is that the target label (i.e., the second/right field)
; should remain visible in all circumstances.

; Label (2-char search)
; The character needed to be pressed to jump to the match position,
; after the whole search pattern has been given. It is always shown on
; top of the second character of the pair.

; Shortcut (2-char search)
; A position where the assigned label itself is enough to determine the
; target you want to jump to (for example when a character is always
; followed by a certain other character in the search area). Those you
; can reach via typing the label character right after the first input,
; bypassing the second one. The label gets a different highlight in
; these cases.
